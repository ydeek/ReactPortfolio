    caption: "My first professional website. Created entirely by myself, featuring a MySQL database and some NPM packages I'd never used before, this application boasts separate pages for customer and employee and will be live at some point in late 2020. I'm so proud of how this turned out and can't wait to see it working for real.",

    altText: "Reel Time",
    caption: "Reel Time is my final graduation project. Utilising a combination of React, Sequelize and Express, and built in a group of 4, this project is a culmination of everything we had learnt on over the previous 6 months. My role in the group was to focus on the back-end, including routing, server setup and database management.",

    caption: "This is an app that allows a user to search for books using the Google Books API. Each book populated features the title, authors, an image and a summary for the user to view. By utilizing the Mongoose library, the user has the choice to save the book to a Mongo database, and then remove it later if they wish, from the Saved Books page.",

    altText: "FurEver Home",
    caption: "I was lucky enough to work with the same group people as I did during 'Fridge Chef' and we grew even further as an adaptable team. We had the option to build the app in React, which we took upon ourselves to attempt. We are happy with the result but do believe that it requires further editing to reach its full potential. The idea for this app was birthed through a strong passion for helping animals and their adoption, as too many are forgotten in shelters. Please adopt!",

    altText: "Halo Themed Clicky Game",
    caption: "I found this one very enjoyable! Built entirely in React, much like this portfolio, I was introduced to the complexities of working in almost an entirely new language. I'm hoping to make all further projects in React as it's very intuitive, logical and fun to work in!",

    altText: "Friend Finder",
    caption: "This app is very similar to 'Which character are you most like?' quizzes that were popular during the Internet's first boom. I enjoyed making this as I got to utilise my favorite film series again - Lord of the Rings. The math required for this app to work properly was challenging but I'm glad to say I overcame it.",

    altText: "LIRI - Node App",
    caption: "LIRI is much like the iPhone's SIRI, but it uses language interpretation rather than speech! LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies and will work through Node's command line input. This was my first, purely back-end application. It opened my eyes to a wider world of programming.",

We set off with the desire to incorporate as many of the technologies we had learnt on our first 9 weeks in the bootcamp, and we are all very satisfied with the end result. I predominantly worked on the Ingredient Entry page and had a lot of fun utilising local storage, however we all were happy to help each other when required. This page lets the user select common ingredients from their fridge and the website returns a recipe.",

    caption: "A Lord of the Rings trivia quiz. With dynamically appending questions, countdown timers and a rating screen at the end, this was one of my favorite projects to work on. Not just because of the theme used, but also because this project was the first one with full creative freedom. My favorite piece of feedback from this was: 'Your UI is beautiful' So proud!",

I designed this page in the colors of my grandfather's favorite style of train, the Southern Railway King Arthur - Sir Lamiel.",

Each crystal contains a value that is intially hidden but reveals itself on the first click. I showed this to my family back in the UK and they had a blast!",
